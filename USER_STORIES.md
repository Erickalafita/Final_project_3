## Story 2: Run Skeleton Application

**As a** full-stack developer
**I need** to verify the skeleton application runs successfully
**So that** I can ensure the basic infrastructure is working before adding features

### Details and Assumptions
* Backend runs on port 3060
* Frontend runs on port 3000
* All dependencies are installed
* Environment variables are configured

### Acceptance Criteria
```gherkin
Given all dependencies are installed
When I start the backend server
Then the server listens on port 3060
And I can access the root endpoint
When I start the frontend application
Then the React app loads on port 3000
And no console errors are present
```

## Story 3: Implement Landing Page and Navigation

**As a** user
**I need** a landing page with navigation
**So that** I can easily browse the GiftLink application and find the features I need

### Details and Assumptions

* Navigation bar includes links to Home, Search, Profile, Login/Register
* Design should be responsive and mobile-friendly
* Uses React Router for navigation

### Acceptance Criteria
```gherkin
Given I am on the GiftLink application
When the page loads

And I see a navigation bar with all main menu items
When I click on any navigation link
Then I am redirected to the corresponding page
And the navigation remains visible and functional
```

## Story 4: Add Authentication Components and Logic

**As a** user
**I need** to register and login to the application
**So that** I can post gifts and manage my profile securely

### Details and Assumptions
* Use JWT for authentication
* Password should be hashed (bcrypt)
* Login state persists across page refreshes
* Auth context manages user state in React

### Acceptance Criteria
```gherkin
Given I am a new user
When I fill out the registration form with valid information
Then my account is created
And I receive a JWT token
And I am redirected to my profile page

Given I am a registered user
When I enter valid credentials on the login page
Then I receive a JWT token
And I am authenticated in the application
And I can access protected routes
```

## Story 5: Implement Gift Details Page

**As a** user
**I need** to view detailed information about a gift
**So that** I can decide if I want to request it

### Details and Assumptions
* Display all gift attributes (name, category, condition, age, description, image)
* Show contact information for the gift poster
* Include a comments section
* Route uses gift ID parameter

### Acceptance Criteria
```gherkin
Given I am viewing the gifts listing page
When I click on a specific gift
Then I am taken to the gift details page
And I see all information about the gift
And I see the poster's contact information
And I can view comments from other users
```

**Label:** `backlog`, `enhancement`

## Story 6: Implement Search Component

**As a** user
**I need** to search for gifts using multiple criteria
**So that** I can quickly find items that match my needs

### Details and Assumptions
* Search by name (partial match, case-insensitive)
* Filter by category
* Filter by condition
* Filter by age (maximum years)
* Multiple filters can be applied simultaneously

### Acceptance Criteria
```gherkin
Given I am on the search page
When I enter search criteria in any combination
Then I see only gifts matching all applied filters
And the results update dynamically
When I clear the filters
Then I see all available gifts again
```

**Label:** `backlog`, `enhancement`

## Story 7: Design and Implement Comments Feature

**As a** user
**I need** to read and post comments on gift listings
**So that** I can ask questions and share information about items

### Details and Assumptions
* Comments are associated with specific gift IDs
* Only authenticated users can post comments
* Comments include user name and timestamp
* Sentiment analysis is performed on comments

### Acceptance Criteria
```gherkin
Given I am viewing a gift details page
When the page loads
Then I see all existing comments for that gift
And each comment shows the author and timestamp

Given I am an authenticated user on a gift details page
When I write a comment and submit it
Then my comment is saved to the database
And the comment appears in the comments list
And sentiment analysis is performed on my comment
```

## Story 8: Research Authentication in React and Express

**As a** developer
**I need** to research best practices for implementing authentication with JWT in React and Express
**So that** I can implement a secure and maintainable authentication system

### Details and Assumptions
* Research JWT token generation and validation
* Understand React Context API for auth state management
* Learn about protected routes in React Router
* Study secure password hashing with bcrypt
* Review token refresh strategies

### Acceptance Criteria
```gherkin
Given I need to implement authentication
When I complete my research
Then I understand how to generate and validate JWTs in Express
And I know how to manage auth state in React using Context
And I can implement protected routes
And I understand password security best practices
And I have documented my findings for the team
```

## Story 9: Containerize Services and Applications

**As a** DevOps engineer
**I need** to containerize the backend, frontend, and sentiment services
**So that** the application can be deployed consistently across different environments

### Details and Assumptions
* Create Dockerfiles for each service
* Use docker-compose for local orchestration
* Backend, frontend, and sentiment services run in separate containers
* MongoDB runs in a container or as a managed service
* Environment variables configured properly

### Acceptance Criteria
```gherkin
Given I have Docker installed
When I run docker-compose up
Then all services start successfully
And the frontend can communicate with the backend
And the backend can communicate with MongoDB
And the sentiment service is accessible
When I access the application
Then it functions identically to the non-containerized version
```

* Deploy to IBM Cloud Code Engine or Kubernetes
* Set up CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions
* Configure environment variables for production
* Set up MongoDB Atlas or managed database service
* Implement HTTPS for secure connections
